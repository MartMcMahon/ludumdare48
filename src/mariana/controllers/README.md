# Controllers

I don't really know what a controller is, but in my mind stuff in this folder tends to be stuff that tells other stuff in the game what to do.
This would probably be the place to map player inputs to specific actions in the games.
This is also the place to manage more high-level controller flow, like in GameController.ts
