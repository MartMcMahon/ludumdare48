# Simon's Notes on the state of the game

  ## Things that are really good

    - The music and sonic atmosphere in general is really great.
    - The harpoon gun is a cool and kinda unique weapon.
    - The terrain generation is not bad.
    - The puffer fish is pretty cool.
    - The idea feels like it has a lot of potential.
    - The bubbles are cool


  ## Things that could be better

    ### It's too easy/no real threat

    Fish don't feel scary. Oxygen doesn't feel like a real threat after a couple upgrade.

    - I think we should bring back the health system so fish are more dangerous

    - Upgrades are way too cheap and powerful


    ### I think it's too focused on killing fish
    
    - You shouldn't start with the harpoon gun, therefore you have to learn other stuff to do before you learn killing fish
    - There should be more neutral fish that don't bother you



    ### It feels extremely short/small

    - Map size is limited because of performance reasons that we can probably solve
    - It's so easy that you can breeze through the content quickly
    - I think content should be more "locked" behind upgrades


    ### Performance

    It looks like our performance cost right now is split almost evenly between rendering and physics

    Performance limits our ability to make the map bigger
     - We could load/unload entities dynamically by region. 

    ### Enemy ideas

    ### Upgrade Ideas

    Upgrades need a lot of 
    - Start with no harpoon
    - More distinct upgrades
      -

    ### Need strong visual ambience to match the music

    - I think dynamic lighting could go a long way towards this
    - More terrain that looks spookier when you get deeper
    - Things feel too floaty in their movement.
      They like they're in space, not water.
      Things should move more freely in 2 dimensions rather than just horizontally

      

    ### Could use a lot of visual polish

    Effects everywhere
    - Waves on the surface
    - Splashes when you/fish/bubbles/spines surface/submerge
    - Dust/silt/fog could be cool
    - Trail of blood when you're bleeding
    - 
    
    Make things prettier
    - Make the shop prettier
    - Draw the boat in higher resolution
    - Hurt red flash is ugly and inconsistent

    ### UX polish
    - 

  ## Ideas for cool features to have in the game

    Dynamic lighting
     - Basically the same as in previous game but without shadows
     - Flashlight based on diver aim direction
     - Glowsticks
     - Depth lighting could be done with one large gradient sprite pretty easily
     - Angler fish
     - Glow in the dark plants
     - Day/night cycle!
  

    Terrain/Flora
     - Current that moves you/sucks you down
     - Geiser that burns you
     - Kepl forests

    More Types of Fish
      - Large segmented (worm) fish
      - Barnacle — shoots when you go by
      - Fish that travel through walls
      - Exploding fish
      - Sword fish — impales you
      - Squid — ink?
      - Electric Eel
    
    Advanced World Generation — Biome
      Choose region for biome based on depth
      Biome determines
      - types of flora and fauna
      - tileset for terrain
      - water color?
      - music?
      - type of resources
      Biome types
      - shark den
      - 



    More meaningful Upgrades
     - Finite and deliberate upgrades for speed and air
       - First oxygen tank
       - Advanced oxygen tank
       - Nitrox mix to be able to go deeper
       - Repreather (almost eliminates bubbles)
       - Flippers
       - Advanced Flippers
       - weight belt/bcd aids in vertical movement only

    Terrain manipulation
     - Seems like it could be cool and honestly not that hard to implement
     - Explosives to mine a few tiles?
     - Pickaxe-like tool to remove individual tiles
